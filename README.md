# lyftTo begin refactoring the codebase to reflect the new design, follow these steps:

Review the New Design: Make sure you thoroughly understand the new architecture you proposed earlier. Familiarize yourself with the class hierarchy, relationships, and the use of composition for flexibility.

Identify Existing Classes to Replace: Identify the classes in the original codebase that need to be replaced based on the new design. This will include the "FleetService" class, "Vehicle" classes, "Driver" class, and any other classes that need restructuring.

Create New Classes: Implement the new classes based on the new design. Start with the base "Vehicle" class and derive specific vehicle classes (e.g., Car, Truck, ElectricVehicle). Then create the "Driver" class, "Component" class, "VehicleComposition" class, and "ServiceCriteria" class.

Move Code Logic: Move the existing logic from the old classes to the new classes. For example, move the logic related to managing vehicles and drivers from the old "FleetService" class to the corresponding new classes.

Update Dependencies: Update the dependencies in the code to use the new classes instead of the old ones. This includes updating imports, references, and any other parts of the code that interact with the classes you've replaced.

Remove Old Classes: Once the code logic has been successfully moved to the new classes, you can safely remove the old classes that are no longer needed.

Compile and Test: After the refactoring, compile the code to ensure there are no syntax errors. While unit tests are not required for this task, you can manually test the application to check if it behaves as expected, considering the new design.

Remember that refactoring is an iterative process. If you encounter any challenges or issues during the refactoring process, don't hesitate to revisit the design and make adjustments as needed. The goal is to achieve a cleaner, more maintainable codebase that aligns with the proposed architecture.

Once you have completed the refactoring, you can push your changes to your forked repository and submit a link to it in the next step as per the task instructions.
